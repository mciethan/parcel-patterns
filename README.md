(under construction)

Project description - start from parcels polygons and attributes, plus tracts or neighborhood geometries, end with parcel ownership classifications (explain the 6) and related visualizations.  

Code descriptions of the four parts and how to run them (inputs, outputs, links between them)

Future version will do all the processing parts in Python geospatial libraries and leave QGIS for visualization.
