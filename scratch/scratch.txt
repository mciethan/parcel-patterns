Game plan for making this a single package / set of standalone scripts

Specify a parcels shapefile, a corresponding assessor table, the parcel IDs and parcel and
owner addresses, the tracts shapefile, a tract identifier, and output file names.
This seems like too much for command line arguments, but could maybe be arguments to a method, 
and then to do multiple years at a time you'd have some outer file calling this in a loop.

Join the assessor table to the parcels shapefile.  Print out how many of the table 
records were joined.

After the parcel join, generate the parcel centroids and spatial join to get each 
parcel's containing tract as an attribute of those centroids.  Print how many of
the parcel centroid were successfully spatial joined.

Run the centroids table through address matching so it gets classified. Join the 
classified table back up with the centroids geometries, if necessary.  

Do the tract joins stuff to count the numbers of parcels per classification in each
neighborhood and write that to a csv.

Also do the flow edges stuff, counting tract-to-tract ownership patterns.
